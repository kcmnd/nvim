# 💤 My Neovim Configuration (Lazy.nvim, Lua-based)

Welcome to my personal Neovim configuration!  
It's written in **Lua**, uses the **Lazy.nvim** plugin manager, and is organized into a modular structure for maintainability and performance. While I primarily use it for **Python development**, it should work with languages like **Go**, **Java**, **Lua**, and web development languages like **HTML/CSS/JS**.

## Folder Structure

```text
nvim/
├── config/
│   └── lazy.lua           # Lazy.nvim setup
├── kc/
│   └── remap.lua          # Custom keymaps
├── plugins/
│   └── *.lua              # Plugin definitions (one plugin per file recommended)
├── init.lua               # Main entry point
└── lazy-lock.json         # Plugin lockfile (generated by Lazy.nvim)
```

## Features

- Written fully in Lua
- Managed with Lazy.nvim
- LSP support for multiple languages (Python, Go, Java, Lua, etc.)
- Autocompletion with nvim-cmp
- Syntax highlighting & parsing via Treesitter
- Fuzzy finding and live grep via Telescope
- File explorer with Neo-tree
- Modular setup for easy editing and extension

## Keybindings

Key Combo	Action:  
`<Space> ff`	Fuzzy file finder (Telescope)  
`<Space> fg`	Live grep search (Telescope)  
`<A-j>` / `<A-k>`	Move lines down/up  
Note: `<A-*>` means holding Alt while pressing the key. You may need to change your terminal to send the correct Alt signal to neovim.  

## Installation

You can install this config in a few simple steps:

```bash
# Backup your existing config if needed
mv ~/.config/nvim ~/.config/nvim.backup

# Clone this config
git clone https://github.com/kcmnd/nvim ~/.config/nvim

# Launch Neovim
nvim
```

Once Neovim opens, Lazy.nvim will automatically install the plugins.
After it's done, run the following command to finalize setup:

```bash
:Lazy sync
```

## Dependencies / Notes

- Make sure neovim is installed (v0.8+ recommended)
- For autocompletion and LSP support:
  - You may need to install pyright, gopls, etc. via npm or your system's package manager.
  - See nvim-lspconfig's supported servers
- Use a Nerd Font for full icon support (e.g., FiraCode Nerd Font)
- Make sure pyright is installed using `npm install -g pyright`
- There's an image in the `assets/` folder you can set as your terminal background to replicate my exact setup. I have a black overlay on it to reduce brightness to ~17%.
